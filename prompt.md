I want to do some exploratory testing.
- launch the AppHost project, this may take up to 10 seconds then navigate to https://localhost:6001 
- Find the login button and click it
- Login with the username "testuser" and password "password123"
- The Login button should now say "Logout"
- Click the Logout button
- The Login button should now say "Login"
- stop the AppHost project to clean up your exploration when you are done
- if you launched a browser, close it when you are done
