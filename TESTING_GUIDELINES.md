# Testing Guidelines

## .NET
- Use Shouldly for assertions
- Use NSubstitute for mocking dependencies

## Frontend
- Use Vitest for UI/component tests

## Integration
- Use Playwright for end-to-end and integration tests (API and UI)

## Best Practices
- Write clear, isolated, and repeatable tests
- Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies where possible
- Include code samples for each tool as needed
